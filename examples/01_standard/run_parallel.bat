    rem When using mpich2 for the first time on a machine:
    rem Execute "smpd -install" as administrator:
    rem     Preparation: Check that your Delft3D installation contains "...\x64\share\bin\smpd.exe". Optionally copy it to a local directory (it will run as a service).
    rem     "Start" -> "All programs" -> "Accessories", right-click "Command Prompt", "Run as Administrator"
    rem     In this command box:
    rem         cd ...\x64\share\bin
    rem         smpd -install
    rem     When there is an smpd already running on the machine, it must be ended first, using the Microsoft Task Manager, 
    rem     or in the command  box: smpd -uninstall
