   - remove filter "CMake Files".
   - in configuration manager for project proj remove configurations MinSizeRel and RelWithDebInfo.
   - in configuration manager for project proj add new platform Win32 by copying settings from x64.
   - in project properties for project proj for all configurations and Win32 platform, in "Librarian -> All Options -> Additional Options" change "x64" to "x86".
   - in project properties for project proj for all configurations and all platforms, make "General -> Output Directory" and "General -> Intermediate Directory" unique for each combination of configuration and platform.
   - exit Visual Studio and save changes.
