/*
 * Provide four levels of assertion control. Assertions provide a mechanism
 * to enforce a contract between a client and service provider. The assertions
 * are listed in order of highest to lowest priority. Assertions can be turned
 * off individually by defining the appropriate name (see preprossessor
 * definitions below), however, lower priority assertions should be turned
 * off prior to higher ones. As confidence in the code increases all assertions
 * can be turned off by defining NO_ASSERTS.
 *
 * The assertions defined below have the following meanings:
 *
 *     INVARIANT - Asserts that a property's state is invariant throughout the
 *                 life of the property's scope. Stating invariant properties
 *                 of an application provides a deeper understanding of the
 *                 application's state.  These statements are usually
 *                 positioned just ahead of the preconditions and just after
 *                 the postconditions.
 *
 *     REQUIRE   - Asserts that a method's preconditions are within their
 *                 valid domains. Preconditions are conditions placed upon
 *                 any state information relied upon for the call. These
 *                 statements should be as close to the top of the method
 *                 as possible (except for assertions on invariant properties).
 *
 *     ENSURE    - Asserts that a method's postconditions are within their
 *                 valid ranges. Postconditions are conditions placed upon
 *                 any state information modified by the call. These
 *                 statements should be as close to the bottom of the method
 *                 (presumably there is only one exit point) as possible
 *                 (except for assertions on invariant properties).
 *
 *     CHECK     - Any other assertion not covered by the above assertions.
 *                 These are often added within a method body to specify
 *                 something that may not be immediately obvious to the reader
 *                 or to validate your assumptions about a call to a 3rd party
 *                 method that does not use runtime assertions for its
 *                 preconditions or postconditions. Obviously if the 3rd party
 *                 method uses assertions then there is no need for the CHECK.
 *
 * Additionally a convenience macro is available to place in code that is
 * pending implementation.
 *
 *     NOT_IMPLEMENTED - Assertion that always fails during runtime for debug
 *                       builds and always fails at compile time for release
 *                       builds.
