subroutine IFormDefaults(IFDEFS)
  integer IFDEFS ! Default settings to activate
  ! 1 : Attributes/colours
  ! 2 : Input parameters
  ! 3 : Frame style
  ! Activates default settings specified in a form definition file in a [defaults] section. The
  ! current form must have been loaded via IFormLoad. The value of IFDEFS
  ! corresponds to one of the records in the [defaults] section. This mechanism allows form
  ! definition files to specify 'global' settings for colours, etc. without hardcoding them into
  ! the application.
  ! Calling IFormDefaults is directly equivalent to calling the following routines,dependent on whether the corresponding default settings have been specified in the
  ! [defaults] section :
  ! IFDEFS = 1 : ITextAttribute/ITextColour
  ! IFDEFS = 2 : InCursorPos/InsertOver/InTypeWipe/etc.
  ! IFDEFS = 3 : IFrameType and IFrameOptions(6/7,N)
  ! It therefore updates the current global settings for colour, etc. Hence, it should be called
  !after IFormLoad and before any routines which cause screen output or input (e.g.
  !IFormShow, IFormEdit, etc.).

  !Note that a default frame type is not used by the forms manager itself, but can still be
  !useful to determine the style of a window frame for the form, if opened subsequently
  !via IFormWindow, IWinOpen, etc. The other parameters set by IFDEFS=3 (i.e. the
  !primary/secondary frame colours) can be used by the forms manager, to determine the
  !colour of any field frames for which the colour is set to 'use the default'.
  !e.g. CALL IFormLoad('W','myform.ifd',LFNERR)
  !C activate default attributes/colours
  !CALL IFormDefaults(1)

  ! Short-name : FMFORM
  ! Defines a new form. All previous form information is deleted. IFormDefine should
  ! be called to create a new form before calling other routines in the FM group. (To load a
  ! form definition from a file see the alternative routine IFormLoad).
  ! Forms can operate relative to the currently selected window or the full screen. The field
  ! co-ordinates should be defined in the IX and IY arrays accordingly, depending on
  ! TYPE. A tabbed form is treated as a multi-part window-based form. In this context, the
  ! 'current' window means the window which is currently selected for output when calling
  ! IFormShow, IFormShowUnp, etc. rather than that which is selected when
  ! IFormDefine is called. Typically a window is selected for output by calling routines
  ! such as IWinOpen or IWinSelect.
  ! INTERACTER Subroutine Reference Form Creation & Editing
  ! 3-5
  ! When TYPE is set to W or S, a single form is created. All of the form is visible at one
  ! time. Alternatively, a tabbed form can be created which consists of multiple windowed
  ! forms which are selectable via tabs at the edge of the form. In this case NFIELD
  ! specifies the total number of fields across all of the sub-forms. The contents of the IX,IY, IWIDTH and ITYPE arrays should then be organised into sub-form order. Hence,
  ! all the fields for sub-form 1 should be at the start of these arrays, followed by the fields
  !for sub-form 2 and so on. Any fields which are needed on all sub-forms (e.g.
  !OK/Cancel) buttons should be placed at the very end of these arrays. Call
  !IFormDefineTabs after IFormDefine to identify the last field on each sub-form
  !and the tab labels.
  !The maximum number of fields which can be defined is documented at the start of this
  !chapter. If NFIELD is larger than the maximum value, additional field definitions are
  !simply ignored. InfoForm can be called to check the number of available fields in the
  !current implementation. Field numbers are reset to 1 to NFIELD, though field
  !identifiers can be reassigned using IFormIdentifier.
  !Various field types can be selected. Type values less than 1000 are treated as
  !unprotected fields, whilst values greater than 1000 are assumed to be protected. Pushbutton
  !and check box fields should be unprotected to allow them to operate correctly.
  !Field types 1 and 8 (strings and long-strings) are equivalent except that an unprotected
  !long-string field allows left/right scrolling within the field, i.e. the enterable string
  !length is longer than the physical field width. Field type 10 is similar to field type 1, but
  !it is not editable and acts as a label for a check box field.
  !Calling IFormDefine suppresses the help-field feature. This can be activated by
  !calling IFormHelp following the call to IFormDefine.
  !IFormDefine generates no screen output. It clears all information from the internal
  !data area which is used to store form related information. Information about individual
  !field position, size and type can be retrieved subsequently via InfoField.

  character(len=*) LABELS(NTABS) ! Array of tab labels
  integer LIMITF(NTABS) ! Array of last-field identifiers
  integer LIMITB(NTABS) ! Array of last-box identifiers
  ! Defines the layout of a tabbed multi-part form. This routine should be called after
  ! IFormDefine('T',..). The fields specified to IFormDefine should be
  ! grouped into sub-forms, with any global fields defined at the end of the field list.
  ! EDGE specifies where the form tabs will appear. If the tabs are placed at the top or
  ! bottom of the form, they will be laid out in either one or two rows, depending on the
  ! width of the form window and the significant lengths of the tab labels specified in
  ! LABELS. If the tabs are placed at the right of the form they appear as a single column
  ! of tabs. In all cases, only as many tabs as will fit in the window are actually displayed.
  ! The LIMITF array describes the identifiers of the last field which lies on each subform.
  ! Effectively this just divides up the list of fields specified to IFormDefine into
  ! sub-forms. If IFormIdentifier has not been called since IFormDefine,LIMITF simply specifies array subscripts, as supplied to IFormDefine.
  ! The LIMITB array is equivalent to LIMITF, but for field boxes. It describes the
  ! identifiers of the last boxes (if any) on each subform. If a particular sub-form contains
  ! no boxes, set that LIMITB value to zero or the same value as the previous sub-form.
  ! As for fields, form-boxes should be grouped into sub-form order in a multi-part tabbed

subroutine IFormEdit(IFINIT,IFEXIT)
  integer IFINIT ! Number of field in which to place cursor initially
  integer IFEXIT ! Number of field in which exit key was pressed
  ! (-999 if all fields protected)
  ! Short-name : FMEDIT
  ! Allows the current form to be edited. The form should already have been displayed
  ! using IFormShow. Think of IFormShow as an output operation and IFormEdit as
  ! an input operation.
  ! The cursor is placed initially on the field specified by IFINIT. If this is a protected
  ! field, IFormEdit will move the cursor to the next unprotected field in the sequence
  ! defined to IFormDefine. If all fields on the form are protected, IFormEdit will
  ! normally exit immediately, returning a negative IFEXIT value and setting an error
  ! code. The exception is tabbed forms, where it is possible to switch between sub-forms
  ! to view their contents.
  ! Since IFormEdit uses input routines such as InStringXYDef, InRealXYDef,InIntegerXYDef, etc. the user enters data in each field in the usual way. Whatever
  ! the field type, the current input field will be highlighted in the manner defined by the
  ! InHighlight routine. All the field editing control keys such as Insert and Delete
  ! work as normal, except for :
  ! �  Cycling menu fields. These use IMenuCycle by default, where the left/right
  ! cursor keys or the space bar cycle through the available menu options. If a pop-up
  ! menu has been enabled in a menu field, pressing control key 34 will toggle between
  ! a simple cycling menu and a vertical menu using IMenuScroll or
  ! IMenuVertic.
  ! �  Vertical menu fields. These use IMenuScroll, where the up/down cursor keys or
  ! the space bar move the highlight through the available menu options.
  ! �  Push button fields. It is only possible to tab in/out of these fields. Pressing confirm
  ! whilst the highlight is on such a field returns the exit-key code associated with that
  ! field.
  ! �  Check box fields. It is only possible to tab in/out of these fields. Pressing control
  ! key 35 ('next item' : usually the space bar) toggles the check box state. If the check
  ! box is attached to a check box description field the highlight actually moves
  ! through the description field rather than the check box itself.
  ! Where a mouse is available, a mouse cursor is automatically enabled on entry. It can be
  ! used within an enterable field to reposition the text input cursor. It can also be used in a
  ! cycling menu or check box field to cycle the available options. In the case of a cycling
  ! menu, the right mouse button which will cause the menu to pop up, if enabled via
  ! IFormPopUpMenu or the IFD file. The actual button used for this function is
  ! definable via InMouseOptions(102,n). If a cycling menu has a frame, a pop-up
  ! button (a downward arrow) will appear in the right-hand edge of the frame. The user
  ! can click on this button to display the pop-up menu. In a vertical menu field, clicking
  ! on a menu option moves the menu highlight to that option.
  ! Alternatively, the mouse can be used to click on any other unprotected field. This has
  ! one of two effects :
  ! INTERACTER Subroutine Reference Form Creation & Editing
  ! 3-9
  ! 1) If it is a push button field, IFormEdit will exit with InfoInput(55) set to the
  ! exit code associated with that field. For example, this might be an 'OK' button with
  ! an associated exit code of 21 (i.e. the same as the 'confirm' control key). Selection
  ! of a push button field takes place either on a button-down or a button-release,dependent on the mouse 'feel' setting (see InMouseOptions(3,n)). The latter
  ! is the default on most displays.
  ! 2) If it is any other type of field, the form highlight moves straight to that field. If it is
  ! a vertical menu field, that menu becomes 'active' a highlight appears in the menu at
  ! the currently selected option and border controls are displayed for mouse users.
  ! Clicking in a check box field (or on an attached description string field) will
  ! immediately toggle the state of the check box.
  ! Pressing a mouse button outside any unprotected field is ignored by default but this
  ! action can be changed via InMouseOptions(2,n). The mouse cursor is returned to
  ! its previous state on exit.
  ! In all fields, the 'exit' control keys are interpreted as follows :
  ! Control Key Action
  ! 21-23 and 26-28 exit from form
  ! 24 and 29 move to next unprotected field
  ! 25 and 30 move to previous unprotected field
  ! 36-70 exit from form
  ! In this sense 'next' and 'previous' fields refer to the order in which fields have been
  ! defined to IFormDefine or in the form definition file. Tab and back-tab will 'wrapround'
  ! at the end or beginning of a form.
  ! The 'spare' exit control keys numbered 26-30 perform the same functions as the
  ! equivalent control keys numbered 21-25. i.e. pressing any of the keys defined as control
  ! keys 26-28 will also exit the form whilst control keys 29 and 30 will act as additional
  ! tab keys. For example, you might wish to make the down/up cursor keys available as
  ! alternative tab/back-tab keys (see the example). The second group of 'spare' exit keys
  ! (36-70) have no special significance. They all simply exit from the form, if defined.
  ! If a pop-up menu has been enabled in a cycling menu field, control key 34 can be used
  ! to toggle a vertical pop-up menu on/off. When a pop-up menu has been activated in this
  ! way the behaviour of the various exit/control keys needs to be understood :
  ! �  Pressing confirm (key 21) within a pop-up menu, closes the pop-up menu and
  ! updates the field contents, but leaves the highlight in the field returning to the
  ! simple cycling menu format. Pressing control key 34 has the same effect.
  ! �  Pressing quit (key 23) or clicking outside the menu with the mouse has the same
  ! effect as confirm, except that the field contents are not updated.
  ! �  Pressing the tab/back-tab keys (24 & 25) or clicking in another field, whilst in a
  ! pop-up menu, closes that menu, updates the field contents and moves the form
  ! highlight accordingly.
  ! �  Pressing any of the remaining exit keys, closes the menu, updates the field contents
  ! and exits from IFormEdit.
  ! Form Creation & Editing INTERACTER Subroutine Reference
  ! 3-10
  ! On exit from IFormEdit, the exit key should be interrogated using
  ! InfoInput(55) in the usual manner. Normally, this will return a value in the range
  ! 21-23, 26-28 or 36-70 if a keyboard exit key was pressed. Alternatively it will return
  ! the exit key code associated with a push button field if a mouse button or confirm was
  ! pressed on such a field. The exit key number can be used in combination with IFEXIT
  ! which returns the number of the field in which the exit key was pressed to take field
  !dependent exit action (e.g. providing field sensitive help).
  !If a resize/expose event occurs in graphics mode in a windowing environment, the form
  !editor will terminate and InfoInput(55) will return a value of 259. The editor will
  !also terminate on a close-window request, returning InfoInput(55) set to 260.
  !If InMouseOptions(2,1/3) has been called and a mouse button has been pressed
  !outside of the 'input area', InfoInput(55) will return a value of -2. In this case, the
  !mouse button and position will be available via InfoInput(61-63) and/or
  !InfoGraphics(5)/(6). See InMouseOptions.
  !All of the above behaviour applies equally to tabbed forms. In addition, a number of
  !labelled tabs will appear at one edge of the form. The mouse can be clicked on these to
  !switch to the appropriate sub-form. Similarly, the Tab/Back-tab keys can be used to
  !move the highlight on/off the labelled tabs. In the latter case the left/right or up/down
  !cursor keys move the highlight through the tab labels. The confirm/Tab/Back-Tab keys
  !can be pressed on any tab to select that sub-form. Whichever method of sub-form
  !selection is used, switching between forms does not exit the form editor.
  !Application specific form processing can be performed using IFormEditUser, an
  !alternative entry point to IFormEdit which allows a user supplied routine to be
  !specified and called from within IFormEdit.

  ! within IFormEdit rather than waiting until the user presses a form-exit key.
  ! Each time the user 'tabs' to another field or presses an exit key, FMUSER is called to

subroutine FMUSER (IFIELD,IEXITK)
  integer IFIELD ! Field number
  integer IEXITK ! 'Exit' key
  ! On entry, IFIELD specifies the field in which the user has just pressed an 'exit' key

  ! number of that key. It will be set to one of the following values on entry :
  ! IEXITK = 21-30 or 36-70
  ! See IFormEdit for the meaning of these exit key codes. The entry value of IEXITK
  ! is the same as would be returned by InfoInput(55).

  ! 3-12
  ! IEXITK = -3
  ! A mouse button has been clicked in the current field which is a vertical menu or a

  ! FMUSER the opportunity to 'see' the updated field value selection.
  ! If required, the identifier of the 'next' field (i.e. the one to which IFormEditUser is
  ! about to pass control) is accessible via InfoForm(3). In a multi-part tabbed form,the current form number is available via InfoForm(8).
  ! On exit, the return values of IEXITK and (optionally) IFIELD, control the behaviour
  ! of IFormEdit in the following manner :
  ! IEXITK returned as zero :
  ! If IFIELD is a valid, unprotected field, the data entry highlight moves straight to this
  ! field. To force the user to re-edit the current field, leave IFIELD unchanged.
  ! Otherwise, this feature can be used to make the user edit a related field or to force the
  ! highlight to move round the form in an order which is different to the default. If
  ! IFIELD is an invalid field or is protected, the data entry highlight remains on the
  ! current field.
  ! IEXITK returned as 21-30 or 36-70 :
  ! IFormEdit will continue processing as though the control key specified by IEXITK
  ! had been pressed. This effectively updates the 'exit key' code which will be returned by
  ! InfoInput(55). Leave IEXITK unchanged if you wish IFormEdit to continue
  ! processing in the normal manner.
  ! IEXITK returned as 259 or 260 :
  ! IEXITK should only be returned with a value of 259/260 if it was set to this value on

  ! IEXITK returned as -2 :
  ! If IEXITK was set to -2 on entry it can safely be returned with this value, allowing

  ! The returned IEXITK code will be ignored. IFormEdit will continue processing the
  ! form based on the exit key code which was passed in to FMUSER.
  ! On return from FMUSER, IFormEdit always updates the on-screen contents of the
  ! field which the user has just entered or tabbed across (i.e. the field specified by the
  ! value of IFIELD on entry to FMUSER). As a result, FMUSER can update the contents
  ! of the current field using the appropriate IFormPut routine without needing to call
  ! IFormShowField to update the screen display.
  ! Behaviour in a tabbed form is essentially the same, except for the added consideration
  ! of what happens when tabs are selected. The following conditions can arise, in which
  ! case the indicated values will be passed to the the user-routine :
  ! INTERACTER Subroutine Reference Form Creation & Editing
  ! 3-13
  ! (a) Selecting a new sub-form using the mouse
  ! IFIELD = Current field, as normal
  ! IEXITK = -2, as normal
  ! InfoForm(3) = First unprotected field on new sub-form
  ! (b) Highlight moving onto a tab via keyboard :
  ! IFIELD = Current field, as normal
  ! IEXITK = Key used to access tabs, as normal
  ! InfoForm(3) = -(tab number)
  ! (c) Highlight moving off a tab via keyboard or mouse :
  ! IFIELD = -(tab number)
  ! IEXITK = Key code or mouse action used to select tab
  ! InfoForm(3) = Next field, as normal
  ! (d) As (c) but the sub-form which is about to be entered has no unprotected fields :
  ! IFIELD = -(tab number)
  ! IEXITK = Key code or mouse action used to select tab
  ! InfoForm(3) = -(tab number)
  ! Whilst FMUSER has a simple calling interface it provides a powerful 'hook' into the
  ! form editor. In particular, nearly all INTERACTER routines are available to be called by
  ! FMUSER. However, power and flexibility also imply a degree of responsibility, so some
  ! basic rules should be observed when writing your own FMUSER user-routines :
  ! �  Other Forms Manager routines can be called, but don't call IFormDefine,IFormLoad, IFormEdit, or IFormEditUser for obvious reasons. Do not
  ! call any routines which use pre-defined forms such as IdFilename.
  ! �  Text attributes are not automatically preserved across a call to FMUSER, so these
  ! should be saved and restored if they are modified during the course of a call.
  ! �  Avoid calling routines which change screen mode.
  ! �  If a particular task can be performed just as well at the level where IFormEdit
  ! would be called as it can using IFormEditUser/FMUSER, do it at the calling
  ! level not in FMUSER.
  ! �  If the form is displayed in a window, be sure that the current window remains
  ! available and selected on return from FMUSER. Other windows can be opened,provided they are closed before exit or IWinSelect is used to reselect the
  ! window which contains the form.
  ! �  The current pop-up mode as selected by InPopup is preserved across a call to
  ! FMUSER, so calls to InPopup are allowed but are only effective for the duration
  ! of that call to FMUSER.

  integer IWIDTH ! Help field width
  ! Short-name : FMHELP
  ! Declares the position and size of a 'help' field. This is a unique field which is

  ! have its own message which appears in the help field whenever the cursor moves onto
  ! that field. Field dependent help messages are definable using IFormPutHelp.
  ! By default, IFormDefine disables the help field feature so a call to IFormHelp
  ! should follow the definition of a new form. To suppress the help field again without
  ! defining a new form simply re-call IFormHelp with a zero IX value.
  ! If an IFD file does not define a help field, calling IFormLoad will also disable the
  ! help field.

subroutine IFormIdentifier(IDENT)
  integer IDENT(*) ! Array of field identifiers

  ! The specified identifiers remain valid until another form is defined. Assigning field
  ! identifiers in this manner allows fields to be more easily added or deleted without
  ! having to change all the field number references in the various other FM routines.

  ! = -2 : Ignore non-fatal errors
  ! = other : Log errors to this logical file number
  ! Short-name : FMLOAD
  ! Defines a new form, loading the definition from a file. All previous form information is
  ! deleted. IFormLoad should be called to create a new form before calling other
  ! routines in the FM group. (To define a new form using program defined arrays see the
  ! alternative routine IFormDefine).
  ! Unlike IFormDefine, IFormLoad defines all of the information required to create
  ! a new form in a single subroutine call. In addition to field position, size and type, other
  ! information can be defined : field attributes, help field information, field values and
  ! ranges. The format of this file is described in chapter 20 of the User Guide. It should
  ! have been created using a text editor, INTFORM or IFormSave. The advantages of
  ! using IFormLoad are thus :
  ! Form Creation & Editing INTERACTER Subroutine Reference
  ! 3-16
  ! �  Forms can be modified without recompilation
  ! �  Form definitions are easier to edit, particularly with INTFORM
  ! �  Programs which use several forms will be smaller. Each call to IFormLoad
  ! replaces the initial call to IFormDefine and the subsequent calls to routines such
  ! as IFormAttribute, IFormPutxxx, IFormGetxxx, IFormRangexxx,IFormHelp, etc. (though the latter routines can still be called after IFormLoad
  ! if required). Similarly, data space requirements are reduced. Programs which use
  ! more than 2 or 3 forms will usually be smaller if IFormLoad is used in place of
  ! IFormDefine.
  ! FILNAM specifies the name of the form definition file. A file extension of .ifd is
  ! recommended ('INTERACTER Form Definition'). IFormLoad first tries to open the
  ! file as specified by FILNAM. If the file is not found it then looks in a directory
  ! specified by the operating system variable INTFMDIR or the initialisation file keyword
  ! FORMDIR. Form definitions can thus be collected in a single directory, the name of
  ! which can change from system to system, but the program need only specify the final
  ! local portion of the full file pathname.
  ! The TYPE argument has the same effect as the equivalent IFormDefine argument.
  ! LFNERR controls how non-fatal errors in the form definition will be handled :
  ! LFNERR = -1 : Terminate IFormLoad if any non-fatal errors occur
  ! LFNERR = -2 : Ignore non-fatal errors and attempt to load as much of
  ! the form definition as is valid
  ! LFNERR >= 0 : Log errors to this Fortran logical file number, which
  ! must be OPEN'ed and CLOSE'd by the calling
  ! program. The line numbers of records which contain
  ! errors are written to this output channel.
  ! During development it may prove useful to set LFNERR to a non-negative value and
  ! log errors to a diagnostics file. Normally, once a form definition has been debugged, a
  ! production program would set LFNERR to -1 or -2. The last line number at which an
  ! error occurred in IFormLoad is also available via InfoForm(4). Note that fatal
  ! errors always terminate IFormLoad regardless of the value of LFNERR.
  ! Errors 36 and 37 are treated as non-fatal. Error number 37 covers a variety of possible
  ! errors including :
  ! - Too many field definitions
  ! - Invalid field position/size/type
  ! - Unknown field identifier
  ! - Ranges not allowed for string/menu/button fields
  ! - Menu already defined
  ! - No. of menu options or initial option missing

  ! from disk using IFormLoad. The form definition file must also have included a
  ! [window] section defining the window size and optional title. If these conditions are
  ! not met, an error is set and no window is opened.
  ! If successful, calling IFormOpenWindow is directly equivalent to calling IWinOpen
  ! or IWinOpenTitle. By opening a window via IFormOpenWindow, a program
  ! need not know how large a particular form is, allowing the same piece of code to
  ! operate on multiple forms.
  ! Just like IWinOpen/IWinOpenTitle, the colour, frame, pop-up status, etc. of the
  ! opened window are all determined by earlier calls to
  ! ITextColour/ITextColourN, IWinAction, etc. If default colours have been
  ! specified in the form file too (in a [defaults] section) it is advisable to call
  ! IFormDefaults before calling IFormOpenWindow.
  ! The presence of a [window] section in a form definition file does not oblige the loading
  ! program to display that form in a window. Similarly, it does not oblige the use of
  ! IFormOpenWindow. The IWinOpen/IWinOpenTitle routines can be called
  ! directly, if preferred.
  ! IXTOPL and IYTOPL have exactly the same meaning as the equivalent arguments to
  ! IWinOpen/IWinOpenTitle.

  ! by the IFormPut routines or by IFormLoad.
  ! The filename used by IFormSave is as defined by FILNAM. No attempt is made to
  ! save the file in the directory specified by the INTFMDIR o.s. variable.
  ! The output file will contain a header record containing the HEADER string. The date
  ! and time of creation is also appended to the header record.
  ! IFormSave can be used to convert programs written to use the IFormDefine

  ! Frame type will normally be specified as a value in the range 1-10, using the same

  ! Sets the frame type, if any, for the specified field. By default, all form fields except

  ! The IFTYPE argument specifies the required frame type. A positive value specifies that
  ! a frame is required on all types of screen. Since box-drawing characters may not be
  ! appropriate for framing fields in some forms, a negative IFTYPE value can be
  ! specified to tell the forms manager to only frame this field when graphical frames are
  ! available. This is a very useful portability feature, allowing form appearance to be
  ! enhanced on graphical displays whilst retaining compatibility with character based
  ! screens/modes. Specify IFTYPE as zero if no frame is required.
  ! Colours are specified using the same conventions as the ITextColour routine. A
  ! blank argument causes the frame to be displayed using the default frame colours as set
  ! by IFrameOptions(6,n)/(7,n). If these frame options are also set to 'default',the text colours set by ITextColour/ITextColourN determine the frame colours.
  ! Field frames are displayed by IFormShow or IFormShowFrame.
  ! Frame type 7 or 8 (or -7/-8) is strongly recommended for push-button fields. The form

  ! If IFormInputParam is not called to define a parameter for a given field or if
  ! IVALUE is specified as zero, the current default setting is used. This will be as defined
  ! by a call to the appropriate IP group routine, before the call to IFormShow,IFormShowUnp and IFormShowField or IFormEdit/IFormEditUser.
  ! Parameter 1 determines field visibility and can be used for the entry of passwords. This
  ! option also affects field output, since IFormShow, IFormShowUnp and
  ! IFormShowField will simply clear the field. Enabling this parameter causes the
  ! field to be invisible. i.e. only enable this feature for password fields.
  ! Parameter 2 selects left or right justification of numeric values when the cursor enters
  ! an integer, real or double precision field. This setting is ignored in non-numeric fields.
  ! Parameter 3 places the cursor at the beginning or end of the field value when the cursor
  ! enters a string, integer or real field.
  ! Parameter 4 forces insert/overtype to a specific state regardless of the last setting
  ! selected via the keyboard by the user.
  ! Parameter 5 enables or disables the 'type and wipe' feature. See InTypeWipe for
  ! details of the purpose of this feature.
  ! Parameter 6 enables/disables case conversion on input. Unlike the other parameters,this has three states, 'off', 'upper' and 'lower', in addition to 'default' as set by InCase.
  ! Parameter 7 determines whether the field gravitates towards the left or the right. The
  ! former is more conventional, but the latter can be useful when entering right-justified
  ! numeric values, in which case parameter 2 should also be set to 'right'. This setting is
  ! ignored in long-string fields, which always have left gravity.
  ! Normally, input control parameters will only be used to change the characteristics of an
  ! unprotected string or numeric field. However, it is valid to specify input control
  ! parameters for a protected field, since IFormProtection allows such fields to
  ! become unprotected at any time. Whilst allowable, the use of IFormInputParam to
  ! change parameters on menu or push button fields is not generally useful.
  ! Input control parameter values for a specific field can be retrieved subsequently via the

  ! = 1 : Standard cycling menu, no pop-up option
  ! < MAXOPT : Enable scrolling pop-up menu of this size
  ! = MAXOPT : Enable non-scrolling pop-up menu
  ! Short-name : FMPOPM
  ! Defines the availability and type of a pop-up menu in a cycling (type 4) menu field.By
  ! default, such menus are displayed in a simple cycling format which utilises the
  ! IMenuCycle routine in the form editor. Optionally, the same menu options can be
  ! made to appear in a pop-up menu within the form editor, under keyboard or mouse
  ! control. IOPTN specifies whether such a pop-up menu is available and, if so, its type.
  ! When a pop-up menu is enabled in a cycling menu field, it can be activated by the user
  ! in three different ways :
  ! �  By pressing control key 34 (usually F2/PF2) when the highlight is on the field.
  ! �  Clicking the right mouse button (see InMouseOptions(102,n)) in the field,when the highlight is on that field.
  ! �  If the field has a frame, a pop-up 'button' (a downward arrow) will appear in the
  ! right-hand edge of the frame. The user can click on this button from anywhere on
  ! the form to move the highlight to that field and display the pop-up menu in a single
  ! operation.
  ! Assuming that MAXOPT is the number of options in the menu (as specified in the form
  ! definition file or in a call to IFormPutMenu), then 1<NOPTN<MAXOPT enables a
  ! scrolling pop-up menu in which IOPTN menu options are visible. This menu will be
  ! displayed using IMenuScroll. Alternatively, if NOPTN=MAXOPT, a non-scrolling
  ! pop-up menu will be enabled, which will be displayed using IMenuVertic.
  ! Reset NOPTN to 1 to disable pop-up menus in the specified field. This is the default
  ! setting assigned by IFormDefine. Menus definitions in an IFD file can include the
  ! initial pop-up menu size (see chapter 20 of the User Guide).
  ! If a pop-up menu is enabled, the operation of IFormPutMenu, IFormGetMenu and
  ! IFormPutOption is completely unaffected. Only the behaviour of
  ! IFormEdit/IFormEditUser is changed. Once a pop-up menu is enabled, control
  ! key 34 will toggle the expanded menu on and off. The effect of pressing other control
  ! keys in a pop-up menu is documented further under IFormEdit.
  ! As an alternative to calling IFormPopUpMenu, IFormVerticalMenu can be
  ! called for exactly the same purpose with the added benefit of being able to define the
  ! pop-up menu's frame type. By default, pop-up menus have a single line (type 1) frame.
  ! The pop-up menu availability/size parameter for a specific field can be retrieved
  ! subsequently via InfoField(10).

subroutine IFormRangeInteger(IFIELD,IFMIN,IFMAX)
  integer IFIELD ! Field number

  ! Short-name : FMPUTI
  ! Defines a valid range for an integer field. If the field has not been declared as an integer
  ! field an error code is set. If the field number is unknown the call is ignored.
  ! This call has no immediate on-screen effect. It should be called before IFormEdit to
  ! define the range of values which the user may type into field number IFIELD. By
  ! default range checking on all fields is disabled. To disable range checking on a field
  ! which has had a range set by an earlier call to IFormRangeInteger, specify an
  ! IFMAX value which is less than IFMIN.
  ! To enforce 'minimum-only' range checking simply set the maximum value to a large
  ! positive number. Similarly, specify a large negative number for the minimum value for
  ! a 'maximum-only' range check.
  ! When IFormEdit is called to edit a form, the user will not be allowed to enter an out
  ! of range value in a range-checked field. If a range-checked field is initially undefined
  ! (i.e. it appears on screen as a blank field) the user will be able to tab across that field
  ! without entering a value. However, once a valid value has been entered in a rangechecked
  ! field (either by the user or by calling IFormPutInteger) the user cannot
  ! then clear the field to the undefined state. The calling program can still clear a rangechecked
  ! field using IFormClearField, if required.
  ! Pressing the help or quit keys (control keys 22 or 23) in a range-checked field causes
  ! IFormEdit to terminate immediately, in the normal way. The same is true if a
  ! resize/expose event (259) or close-window request (260) occurs. However, if the user
  ! has just entered an out of range value in that field, the previous (valid) field contents
  ! will be restored. This ensures that it is possible to get out of a form (to backtrack,display help or redraw the screen) while maintaining the integrity of the form's data.
  ! When an invalid value is entered in a range-checked field and an attempt is made to
  ! move to another field or to confirm the form, the bell will sound and the cursor will be
  ! repositioned to the start of the field with the highlight still on the invalid entry. No error
  ! message is output. Messages which describe the valid range can be included in either a

  ! controls the size/appearance of a pop-up menu in exactly the same way as
  ! IFormPopUpMenu except that frame type can also be specified.
  ! The number of visible options should be less than or equal to the current maximum
  ! number of options stored in the field. If NOPTN is less than the maximum number of

  ! The IFRAME argument determines the frame type of pop-up menus (if IFIELD

  ! (i.e. a type 7 field). The latter is better specified via IFormFrame, or the [fields]
  ! section of an IFD file. Consequently, an out-of-range value can be specified meaning
  ! 'leave the current frame type unchanged'. A value of 999 is recommended in this case. If
  ! no frame is required, set IFRAME to zero, as for IFormFrame.

  ! IDFIELD can be used to establish a link to a description field (i.e. a field of type 10).
  ! When such a link is established, clicking on the check box not only toggles its state but
  ! moves the field highlight to the description field rather than the check box. Further
  ! clicks on the check box (or the description string field) will continue to cycle the check
  ! box state whilst leaving the highlight on the description field. If using the keyboard, an
  ! attempt to tab into the check box field will also move the highlight into the description
  ! field, but will not cycle the field until control key 35 is pressed.
  ! Whilst the above behaviour is consistent with most popular GUI's, some developers
  ! may prefer to force the user to click in the check box itself and not have the highlight
  ! move through the description field. Set IDFIELD to zero in this case.
  !If the description field number has already been defined (e.g. in a form definition file)
  !and does not need to be changed, simply pass IDFIELD set to -1.
  !If check box and description fields are to be connected, it is advisable to define them
  !consecutively in the form. The contents of check box descriptions fields (type 10) can
  !be set via IFormPutString.

  ! Short-name : FMPUTD
  ! Puts a value into a double precision field on the current form. If the field has not been

  ! effect. The field value will only be displayed when IFormShow,IFormShowUnp or IFormShowField is called.
  ! FRMAT determines the format in which the double precision value will be displayed. If

  ! 1) If, since the most recent call to IFormDefine, IFormPutDouble has been

  ! 2) If IFormPutDouble has not been called with the specified value of IFIELD
  ! since IFormDefine was last called and the field contents were not defined in a
  ! form definitions file, a default format is set up. This uses Fortran F format, the field
  ! width and a single decimal place. Hence if the field width is 6 characters, the stored
  ! format will be (F6.1).
  ! To define FRMAT without specifying a field value, use IFormPutFormat instead.

  ! Each field on the form can have its own help message which is only displayed when the
  ! user moves the cursor onto that field in IFormEdit. Initially, when IFormDefine

  ! such messages to be defined. The help field will be cleared by IFormEdit whenever
  ! the cursor is in a field for which the help message is undefined. Hence it is only
  ! necessary to define help messages for those fields which require additional prompts.
  ! When defining a help string for a check box field be sure to specify the number of the

  character(len=*) OPTION(MAXOPT) ! Array of menu options
  integer IOPTN ! Number of initially highlighted option
  ! Short-name : FMPUTM
  ! Puts a set of options into a cycling or vertical menu field on the current form. If the
  ! field has not been declared as a menu field an error code is set. This call has no
  ! immediate on-screen effect. The field value will be displayed when IFormShow,IFormShowUnp or IFormShowField is called. At that point, the array element
  ! OPTION(IOPTN) will be displayed in the required field. IOPTN is also stored as the
  ! default menu selection and will be returned by IFormGetMenu if no menu selection
  ! is made by the user.
  ! The first time IFormPutMenu is called, for a given field, after a form has been
  ! created using IFormDefine, MAXOPT also defines the maximum number of menu
  ! options this field can hold. Subsequent calls to IFormPutMenu can then vary the
  ! number of menu options provided they do not increase the menu size beyond the
  ! originally defined maximum. Similarly, if the form is initially defined using a form
  ! definition file (via IFormLoad) subsequent calls to IFormPutMenu can vary the
  ! menu size, subject to the same limitation, that they may not increase the menu size.
  ! This allows the initial menu declaration to reserve the maximum amount of menu space
  ! which will ever be required, while still allowing the actual menu items to be changed
  ! dynamically without redefining the entire form.
  ! By default, type 4 menu fields are displayed in a simple cycling format, which uses
  ! IMenuCycle in the form editor. These fields can optionally be displayed in a vertical
  ! pop-up format, under keyboard/mouse control. See IFormPopUpMenu for details.
  ! The availability/size of a pop-up menu is unaffected by a call to IFormPutMenu.

  ! Type 7 menus are displayed as a vertical list of options, which uses IMenuScroll in

  ! frame. However, these settings can be subsequently modified (to give a scrolling
  ! vertical menu and/or a frame) by calling IFormVerticalMenu. Forms defined via
  ! an IFD file can include the total menu size, number of visible options and frame type as
  ! separate parameters.
  ! The current and maximum number of options in a specific menu field can be retrieved
  ! subsequently via InfoField. The option strings are accessible via InfoFormMenu.

  ! optionally using IClearScreen or IWinClear, before calling IFormShow.
  ! Any form-boxes defined as part of the form are displayed first, before the form fields.
  ! By default, all form-boxes are displayed using the frame-types/colours currently
  ! selected by the routines in the AT/CG groups (either directly or via
  ! IFormDefaults). Individual form-box attributes can be set using
  ! IFormBoxN/IFormBox. The form-box display incorporates a frame-intersection
  ! algorithm which ensures that frames are usually joined up neatly.
  ! After the form-boxes (if any), the field contents and their frames are displayed. By
  ! default, all form fields are displayed using the attributes/colours currently selected by
  ! the routines in the AT group (either directly or via IFormDefaults). Individual field
  ! attributes can be set using IFormAttributeN/IFormAttribute.
  ! If field frames are enabled they are displayed in the colours set by IFormFrame or the

  ! colours are determined by ITextColour, ITextColourN or IFrameOptions.
  ! Any 'background' (i.e. text/graphics already on the screen) will not be affected by
  ! IFormShow unless the form-boxes and fields overlap with the background. If only the
