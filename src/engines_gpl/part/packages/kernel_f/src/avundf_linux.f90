! Routine ad hoc:
! Avoid a nasty problem with underflows on Windows 95/98.
!
! Usage:
! Call this routine once early in the program, for instance just after 
! start-up.
!
! Note:
! It contains statements specific for Digital/Compaq Visual Fortran.
! This means that under UNIX you will need to comment out most of the 
! code, an empty routine will suffice.
!
! Note:
! It even contains some extensions defined by Digital Visual Fortran
