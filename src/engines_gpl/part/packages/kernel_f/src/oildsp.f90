!>         <ul><li> Initial gravity spreading through radius
!>         Oil released through dye releases will have an initial gravity spreading at the
!>         water surface where it floats on. This routine is able (optrad(id) .eq. 1) to
!>         compute this radius using the Fay-Hoult formula. The actual release, using these
!>         radius values, takes place in the dye release routine part09.f90.\n
!>         Estimate of initial radius from adios user's manual (p4.9), NOAA 1994\n
!>         ref: fay,j. and d.hoult, 1971. 'physical processes in the spread of oil on
!>         a water surface',report dot-cg-01 381-a. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Coast Guard.
!>         <li> Volatilisation and emulsification through changes of weigth
!>         All oil particles have always 3 weight factors<ol>
!>         <li> floating on the water surface
!>         <li> dispersed over the water column
!>         <li> sticking at the bed</ol>
!>         Depending on the location of the weight of the particle it is succeptible to
!>         wind and water driven transport, transport in the water only or it is laying on
!>         the bed.
!>         <li> Different oil fractions with different characteristics
!>         It is possible to release different oil fractions that behave differently
!>         with one particle. The code has had a maximum of 4 fractions. During subsequent
!>         changes it is tried to remove that maximum and to let it be up to the user.
!>         If 2 fractions are used, each particle has 6 weight factors, 3 for each fraction.
!>         Note that only the particles move, so the fractions in a particle move always the
!>         same. It is therefore recommended to specify multiple batches of particles, one only
!>         with fraction 1, .. etc.
!>         <li> Entrainment (emulsification) of oil through sophisticated techniques
!>         The entrainment of particles from the water surface to the watercolumn is computed
!>         here. It is possible to specify a constant entrainment factor per day (ioptd(ifrac) .eq. 0).
!>         It is also possible to use the advanced formula of Delvigne and Sweeny (ioptd(ifrac) .eq. 1).
!>         Steady state oil distribution approximation from Adios used with maximum droplet
!>         size of 70 micron. See Adios User's Manual p 4-12.\n
!>         If a random number is lower than the fraction entrained, the whole floating mass is
!>         migrated to the watercolumn weight. For enough particles, the net effect is that indeed
!>         the correct fraction is entrained.\n
!>         Note that for entrainment unpredictable results are reached if the particle really has
!>         multiple fractions and one fraction wants to entrain whereas the other wants be remain floating.\n
!>         Volatilisation only takes place for floating oil. A constant volatilisation rate per day
!>         is specified for that. This reduces the weight of the particle. The amount of volatised
!>         oil is also accumulated (like many other characteristics).\n
!>         <li> Sticking of oil at the water bed through sticking probability
!>         Whether submerged oil sticks is determined by the stickyness probability. The actual sticking
!>         takes place in the advection diffusion routine (part10.f90), together with the migration
!>         of the weight from the dispersed box towards the sticking box.\n
