!     Type    Name         I/O Description

      real(4) pmsa(*)     !I/O Process Manager System Array, window of routine to process library
      real(4) fl(*)       ! O  Array of fluxes made by this process in mass/volume/time
      integer ipoint( 37) ! I  Array of pointers in pmsa to get and store the data
      integer increm( 37) ! I  Increments in ipoint for segment loop, 0=constant, 1=spatially varying
      integer noseg       ! I  Number of computational elements in the whole model schematisation
      integer noflux      ! I  Number of fluxes, increment in the fl array
      integer iexpnt(4,*) ! I  From, To, From-1 and To+1 segment numbers of the exchange surfaces
      integer iknmrk(*)   ! I  Active-Inactive, Surface-water-bottom, see manual for use
      integer noq1        ! I  Nr of exchanges in 1st direction (the horizontal dir if irregular mesh)
      integer noq2        ! I  Nr of exchanges in 2nd direction, noq1+noq2 gives hor. dir. reg. grid
      integer noq3        ! I  Nr of exchanges in 3rd direction, vertical direction, pos. downward
      integer noq4        ! I  Nr of exchanges in the bottom (bottom layers, specialist use only)
      integer ipnt( 37)   !    Local work array for the pointering
      integer iseg        !    Local loop counter for computational element loop

!     we might not have the bloom parameters loaded yet. This could already be done here or in BLOOM? Only the first time step.
!     this is in a module/include, so we might put a flag if it was read of not.
!     this should be a 'proto-proces', and thus needs to be added to the BLOOM.SPE
