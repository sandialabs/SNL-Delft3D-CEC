!>       Radio-active decay and estimation of the radiation
!!       Because the module produces both the radio-active decay (as a
!!       flux and an estimate of the radiation, it requires the atomic
!!       mass of the substance. The concentration is expected to be in
!!       mg/m3, so that the radiation is in Bq/m3.
!!
!!       Usage note:
!!       The half-life and the atomic mass are physical constants. The
!!       module therefore assumes they are DELWAQ constants, not
!!       general input parameters. This is slightly more efficient.
