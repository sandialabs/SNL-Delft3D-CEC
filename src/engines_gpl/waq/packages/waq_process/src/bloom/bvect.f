! To tell Bloom how much biomass of the living phytoplankton
! species is left at the end of the time-step, the 'minimum
! biomass' of each species is set in the B-vector. This value is used
! as the mortality constraint (the minimum biomass to be returned
! by simplex).
! The new, minimum biomass levels are also stored in the original
! XDEF-vector. This is to enable the program to deal with infeasible
! solutions for example due to light limitation.
