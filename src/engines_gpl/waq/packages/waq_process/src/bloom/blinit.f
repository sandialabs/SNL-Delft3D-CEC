!     Convert BLOOM II specific units to DLWQWQ specific units
!
! Assuming that concentration units in the calling program are g/m3,
! where as BLOOM II uses mg/m3, it is necessary to convert
! 1.  the specific extinction coefficients
! 2.  the carbon to chlorophyll ratio (and hence the dry weight to
!     chlorophyll ratio)
! of all phytoplankton types.
! The specific extinction coefficient of detritus.
! The base and top levels of the growth and mortality constraints.
