!>         This routine computes the new volumes rather than reading them
!>         from file. Together with the closure error correction routine this
!>         gives the posibility to deal with non-mass conserving hydrodynamics.
!>         This is something you should not want. It violates the mass balance
!>         of the substances in the same way as the water balance is violated.
!>         The end result is that you are never certain of anything in your
!>         water quality model. Decent modellers should not use this option.
!>         Bert Jagers was dealing with the Selfe model that did not conserve.
